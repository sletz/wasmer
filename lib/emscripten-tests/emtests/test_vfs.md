The wasm file `test_vfs.wasm` is generated by compiling the `test_vfs.c` and writing a tar.zst blob with a single file 
named `data.txt`. 

The program expects to find a file named `data.txt` and reads the contents and the file descriptor. 

The runtime should mount the virtual filesystem and expose the file.
